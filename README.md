Repo for testing path-planning ideas

Main requirements:
 Robot must first determine the scope of the area
 Robot will have a sensor this can be used to help map out the area as it moves within the 3d space. 
 Robot must explore entire space
 Robot must try and take the shortest path
 Robot must avoid obstacles
 Robot must be able to remember obstacles
 Robot can traverse previous nodes/3d space so long as helps shorten the path taken or if it has no where else to move.
 Robot can move horizontally or vertically
